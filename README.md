# Network Theory: Economic Growth and Shock Simulation

This repository contains the implementation of a network simulation model designed to analyze economic growth over time and the effects of economic shocks on the network. The model simulates the growth rate and fluctuations in an economy and explores how networks evolve in response to shocks. This project focuses on analyzing economic value chains and network interdependencies.

## Folder Structure

- **Analysis**: Python code and scripts used for simulating economic growth and network interactions.
- **Results**: Contains the figures and tables generated from simulations, including graphs depicting the economic recovery post-shock.
- **Report**: Contains the LaTeX source files for the project report and the compiled PDF report.
- **Creatives**: (Optional) Folder for visual representations, infographics, or other creative outputs of the project's results (currently not available).
